As digital agencies a lot of time and money is invested on build solutions for clients and when the next client comes along they may want a completely different CMS.  This will causes a lot of code that was written for one CMS to be unusable for site written in another.

There is also the ramp up time getting something in front of a client.  When you provide solutions in an agile manner it is important to get things them quickly and frequently.

What I want to do is build an abstraction for any .NET CMS systems that provides common functionality such and News, Blogs, Forms, ect.  Also giving developers an insight how to extend in a maintainable, extendable, and testable way.
